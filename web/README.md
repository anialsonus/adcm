## Running unit tests

## i18n internationalization
Static translations are located in the folder ```web/src/assets/i18n/static/[lang].json``` 
(```[lang]``` is the lang that you're using, for english it could be "en")

Example: 
```json
  {
    "display_name": "Name",
    "version": "Version",
    "license_path": "License text",
    "license": "License status"
  }
```

You can either use the TranslateService, the TranslatePipe or the TranslateDirective to get your translation values:
With the service, it looks like this:
####service:

```typescript
  //async
  translate.get('display_name').subscribe((res: string) => {
    console.log(res);
    //=> 'Name'
  });

  //sync
  const res = translate.instant('display_name');
  console.log(res);
  //=> 'Name'

```

####pipe:

```angular2html
  <div>{{ 'display_name' | translate }}</div>
```

####directive:
```angular2html
  <div translate>display_name</div>
```
