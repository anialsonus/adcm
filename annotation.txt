There are three variants of adding multi_state in action masking:
1. original 'masking', proposed by @cab - described in ADSS-1996
2. 'simplified masking'
   - removed 'unavailable' from state,
   - removed 'any' from unavailable multi_states
3. 'extended legacy'
   - no 'masking' key
   - 'state' key has same behavior as before
   - 'multi_state' has same behavior as in 'simplified masking'


Exammples for each variant cover these cases:
- action available for state `installed`
- action available for state `installed` and multi_state `kerberized`
- action available for state `installed` and multi_state `kerberized` except `custom kerberos`
- action available for any state and multi_state `kerberized`

Each example has full version and version without default values (when applicable).

Keys 'on_fail' and 'on_success' were intentionally ommited.
