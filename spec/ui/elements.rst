Popups
======

Issue/Flag Popup
----------------

This popup is for showing flags and issue provided by backend as an "agenda" endpoint. For every object in ADCM there is a way to rise flag.

Format of flag entry in "agenda" endpoint could be seen in this example.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "message": "Run ${action1} on on ${component1}.",
        "id": 2039,
        "placeholder": {
                "action1": {
                    "type": "component_action_run",
                    "ids" : {
                        "cluster": 1,
                        "service": 2,
                        "component": 2,
                        "action": 22
                    },
                    "name": "Restart"
                },
                "component1": {
                    "type": "component_config",
                    "ids" : {
                        "cluster": 1,
                        "service": 2,
                        "component": 2
                    },
                    "name": "My Component"
                }
        }
    }

Main parts of the format are:

* "message" == The string which is show in UI
* "placeholder" == The objects which should be replaced in "message"


Main idea behind this format is the way to represent a clickable links or other templates  in this format. Most of element like links could not be build on backend because of lack of information about pages, urls and elements.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "component1": {
            "type": "component_config_link",
            "ids" : {
                "cluster": 1,
                "service": 2,
                "component": 2
            },
            "name": "My Component"
        }
    }

Here we have the following elements:

* component1 == name of placeholder in a message (see full format above)
* type == it is a type of list (the way this list should be generated)
* ids == information required to build full URL in UI
* name == just a string to be place to <a></a> element.

So for this links we should build the following HTML element

.. code-block:: html

   <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/cluster/1/service/2/component/2/config">My Component</a>
